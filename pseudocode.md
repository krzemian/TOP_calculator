# PSEUDOCODE (remaining stuff)
- TODO: Value parsing, though that would not be needed if the user clicks buttons only
- TODO: Make keyboard, but disregard any other keys except for the ones that make sense for calculating (+, -, /, *, 0–9 – what about pwr and sqrt?)
- TODO: Better float multiplication [ (*100 + *100)/10000 ]
- Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.
- Add keyboard support! You might run into an issue where keys such as (/) might cause you some trouble. Read the MDN documentation for event.preventDefault to help solve this problem.
