// TODO: Value parsing, though that would not be needed if the user clicks buttons only
// TODO: Make keyboard, but disregard any other keys except for the ones that make sense for calculating (+, -, /, *, 0–9 – what about pwr and sqrt?)
// TODO: Better float multiplication [ (*100 + *100)/10000 ]

// TODO: How should I handle additional user input after some initial operations? Should I keep updating the operands? If so, which one, x or y?
